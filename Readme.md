# How to change the Grid's height  according to the total height of its rows


<p>The size of each GridView's element is calculated by the GridViewInfo class. The instance of the GridViewInfo class, containing information about a specific GridView instance, can be obtained via the GridView.GetViewInfo method. This method is hidden for IntelliSence,  but is public and can be called from external code.</p>
